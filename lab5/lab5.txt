Calculation of means: mean
=media aritmetica
Variances: var
	v^2=1/n*sum(1,n)(Xi-X_)^2

sample:
s^2=1/n-1*sum(1,n)(Xi-X_)^2 ==MATLAB var(x)

v,s standard deviation = std

CONFIDENCE INTERVALS:
X= measures a characteristic of a poppulation 
pdf of X by f(x,theta)
theta = unknown param

sample of size n X1, X2,...Xn independent & identically distributed

mean(theta)= mean(theta)(X1, X2,...Xn)-- point estimate
interval estimate we find 2 values mean(theta)L, mean(theta)u s.t.

W depends on the selection data on theta
